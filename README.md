# Matching-Card-Game-Web

This matching card game purely used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to write.

The design followed:
1. A set of cards with numbers on them are placed face down at start.
2. In each turn, the player can click on three cards to turn them over, revealing their
numbers.
3. If the three cards are with the same number, a triple is found.
4. If the three cards are with different numbers, the cards will be covered again to hide
their number.
5. The game continues until all cards are revealed.

Basic Requirements:
1. A user interface displaying the game title and instructions.
2. The number of cards can be set to any multiple of 3 by the players.
3. The set of cards should be shuffled on each round of the game.
4. The game should be visually appealing by using CSS. The cards should animate when
they are selected or flipped.
5. The game should be developed using only JavaScript. No other programming
languages or libraries are allowed.
6. The game should run in a web browser and should be accessible to all users, regardless
of the device or screen size.
7. The programs should have proper comments, explaining the code.

Advanced Requirements:
1. A scoring system that keeps track of the player's progress and displays the current
score on the user interface. The player should earn points for each successful match
and lose points for each incorrect guess.
2. A timer that keeps track of the time elapsed and ends the game when a specified
time limit is reached.
